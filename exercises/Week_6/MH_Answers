1. For conditions recorded in the year 2012, how many distinct patients received each condition? Show the condition concept ID and the patient count.


--QUESTION: Is that supposed to be "For conditions recorded in the year 2010?" (instead of 2012)?

SELECT 
  condition_concept_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) AS patient_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence`
WHERE condition_start_date BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31'
--EXTRACT(YEAR FROM condition_start_date) = 2010
GROUP BY condition_concept_id;

2. What is the total count of conditions recorded for each patient whose gender is 'MALE' and who was born before 1950?
(Hint: you may or may not need the columns specifically included in the main query)

WITH condition AS (
  SELECT
    person_id,
    condition_occurrence_id
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence`
),
patient AS (
  SELECT person_id
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.person`
      WHERE
      gender_concept_id = 8507 -- Concept ID for 'MALE'
      AND year_of_birth < 1950
)
SELECT
  t2.person_id,
  COUNT(t1.condition_occurrence_id) AS total_conditions
FROM condition AS t1
INNER JOIN patient AS t2
  ON t1.person_id = t2.person_id
GROUP BY t2.person_id;

3. In the entire dataset, compare the number of times Diabetes (Concept ID: 201820) was recorded versus the number of times Hypertension (Concept ID: 320128) was recorded, grouped by the condition's source value text.

SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN condition_concept_id = 201820 THEN 1 END) AS diabetes_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN condition_concept_id = 313217 THEN 1 END) AS afib_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence` 
WHERE condition_concept_id IN (201820, 313217)

4. Find all unique condition source values where the text contains a 3-digit number.

WITH source_values AS (
  SELECT condition_source_value
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_synthetic_patient_data_omop.condition_occurrence`
  WHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(condition_source_value, r'[0-9]{3}')
)
SELECT DISTINCT condition_source_value
FROM source_values;
